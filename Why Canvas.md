## :one: Start at the End

Start by imagining your end result and risks along the way. Then work backward to figure out the steps youâ€™ll need to get there.

### Facilitation steps
<p><strong>Set a long term goal. Get <em>optimistic</em> hat:</strong> (15 mins)<br>
<strong><em>Ask:</em></strong> Why are we here today and what does success looks like to us? Where do we want to be in six months (short term goal), a year, or even five years (long term goal) from now?</pr>

<p><strong>List questions. Get <em>pessimistic</em> hat.</strong> (15 mins)<br>
<strong><em>Ask:</strong></em> How could we fail? What do we need to do to get there think backward steps.
Facilitator tips:  Turn these fears into questions and list those questions in the whiteboard.</pr>

<p><strong>Cluster:</strong> (10 mins)<br>
Ask the team to cluster and group them in short term vs long term goal</pr>

<p><strong>Draw a map:</strong> (20 mins)<br>
Finally draw backwards on a map of a system, journey starting from the end goal</p>

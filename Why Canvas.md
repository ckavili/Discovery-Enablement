## :one: Start at the End

Start by imagining your end result and risks along the way. Then work backward to figure out the steps you’ll need to get there.

### Facilitation steps
<p><strong>Set a long term goal. Get <em>optimistic</em> hat:</strong> (15 mins)<br>
<strong><em>Ask:</em></strong> Why are we here today and what does success looks like to us? Where do we want to be in six months (short term goal), a year, or even five years (long term goal) from now?</pr>

<p><strong>List questions. Get <em>pessimistic</em> hat.</strong> (15 mins)<br>
<strong><em>Ask:</strong></em> How could we fail? What do we need to do to get there think backward steps.
Facilitator tips:  Turn these fears into questions and list those questions in the whiteboard.</pr>

<p><strong>Cluster:</strong> (10 mins)<br>
Ask the team to cluster and group them in short term vs long term goal</pr>

<p><strong>Draw a map:</strong> (20 mins)<br>
Finally draw backwards on a map of a system, journey starting from the end goal</p>

### Facilitator Guide: Strategy
- When defining what success looks like, it may be helpful to focus on goal setting from the perspective of the customer and business. Identify what value or success looks likes for your customer. Then define what value you are looking to achieve for your business.


- The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do. It’s surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears.


- It’s easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms. We’d recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.

## :two: Cover Story

Cover story is a Design Thinking practice forces participants to start with the end mindset. 

The team is encouraged to visualise, image and even sketch their wildest ideas and plant seeds for the future state of the organisation so spectacular that they have put the business on the cover of a well-known magazine.

### Facilitation steps
- Divide the team into 4-6 people
- Draw out large-scale templates that include the categories as listed in the image. 
- Define each category on the template
- Diverge: Ask the team to populate the template with the sticky note and write and draw together (5-10 mins)
- Emerge: Ask the team to quietly imagine their best case scenario story relates to them quietly - (5 mins)
- Converge: Ask the team to agree on one one topic and generate the “story of the year” and represent it on their team collaboratively. (30 - 45 mins)
- Discuss: Ask in the room what they observed, any insights and concerns about the future state (5-10 mins)

### Facilitator Guide: Strategy
This game is about the wildest dream for the organization—that has already happened! So, when you set up this game as the meeting leader, speak about their “successes” with enthusiasm and in the past tense. Encourage the players to use the past tense in their brainstorming and story creation. And don’t let the group go into analysis mode. This game is not about logic, pragmatism, or parameters. Cover Story is an open-ended, creative-thinking exercise, so tell the players to be wary of any “reality checks” from other players. And as the small groups present their visions to the large group, note and discuss any common themes that arise. These themes—however fantastical—are telling, because commonalities reveal shared hopes and also plant seeds for real possibilities. If this play is part of a longer group process, post these visions around the room so that they serve as reference points for continued ideas and inspiration.
